BEHAVIOR SIMULATIONS:
F7: 1 player behavior simulation
F8: full team behavior simulation
F9: penalty kick behavior simulation

LOCALIZATION SIMULATION:
F10: 1 player localization simulation
F11: full team localization simulation
F12: penalty kick localization simulation

c: show kick region
z/x: change region resolution

/: show best kick
[]: loop through possible kicks

SIMULATION MODE:
i/j/k/l: move robot
u/o: rotate robot
w/a/s/d: move ball

e: set (with ctrl forces manual placement, shift forces placement into the desired positions)
p: playing
q: penalize
f: make fall over
m: switch kickoff
1-(1)0: switch to this player's view
` (backtick): see ground truth view
ctrl+1-(1)0: highlight this robot
right: simulate one step
up:    simulate 3 steps
down: fast forward to a frame with localization error
ctrl+r: restart lua for players
ctrl+p: set debugging_positioning to true (no falling, kicking, or pushing)


In Live mode:
r/b: listen to red/blue team packets
0 or `(backtick): show all teammate packets
